# neutral_color
Finding colors that have the least color contrast with all other colors in the sRGB color space. I'm using this project to learn about coding Rust.

### Current findings:
Currently generates `(109, 110, 66)`: has the __lowest maximum__ color difference of `0.5895155`

After experimentation, `(169, 128, 149)` has the __lowest average__ color difference of `0.285581737757`. For comparison, `(109, 110, 66)` has a higher average of `0.342466533184`
