# neutral_color
Finding colors that have the least color contrast with all other colors in the sRGB color space. I'm using this project to learn about coding Rust.

### Current findings:
`difference::hyab` generates `(109, 110, 66)` with `0.5895155`

`difference::absolute` generates `(102, 131, 112)` with `0.6399138`
